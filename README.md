## Important Notes

- Always verify the processed grades and comments before submission.

## FAQ
### **Does this violate the DOE Data Privacy and Security Policies?**
No, the EGG File Processor does not violate DOE student data policies.

The tool only processes numerical grade inputs and does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable student information (PII) such as names, ID numbers, or other sensitive data. Users manually enter or paste only numerical grades, which are then modified based on predefined rules before being returned as an Excel file. Since the tool does not interact with student records, school databases, or external servers, it fully complies with data privacy regulations and DOE policies. ðŸš€

### **What happens if I don't specify adjusted grades?**
The grades within that range will remain unchanged.

### **Can I add overlapping grade ranges?**
No, overlapping ranges are not allowed. Ensure all ranges are unique.

### **How do I remove or edit existing criteria?**
Use the **Edit** or **Remove** buttons for each rule in the list.

### **Does the EGG File Processor save my grade criteria?**
Yes, the EGG File Processor saves your grade criteria in your browser. Your grading criteria is stored locally using browser storage (localStorage), so they remain available even after you close or refresh the page. However, since the data is only saved in your browser, it wonâ€™t be accessible if you switch devices or clear your browser storage.
